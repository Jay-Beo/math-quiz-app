You want to create a math quiz game similar to Kahoot, featuring a timer, math questions, and four answer choices with different colors. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Quiz Screen:** Display the math question, timer, and four answer choices with distinct colors.\n*   **Scoring System:** Implement a basic scoring system that awards points for correct answers and deducts points for incorrect answers or time-outs.\n*   **Timer:** A visible timer that counts down, adding urgency to the game.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#007BFF` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#6C757D` (Gray)\n    *   Accent: `#28A745` (Green)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight Colors (for answer choices):\n        *   `#FF4136` (Red)\n        *   `#FF851B` (Orange)\n        *   `#2ECC40` (Green)\n        *   `#0074D9` (Blue)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create a Quiz Screen:**\n    *   Create a new file named `QuizScreen.tsx` in the `app/(tabs)/(home)` directory.\n    *   Implement the UI for displaying the math question, timer, and four answer choices.\n    *   Style the answer choices with the specified highlight colors.\n2.  **Implement the Scoring System:**\n    *   Add state variables to track the score, current question, and timer.\n    *   Implement logic to update the score based on the user's answer and the remaining time.\n3.  **Add a Timer:**\n    *   Use `setInterval` to create a timer that counts down.\n    *   Display the remaining time on the screen.\n4.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Add a button on the home screen to navigate to the `QuizScreen`.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement this plan. After that, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-07T22:01:18.664278"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a math quiz game similar to Kahoot!
